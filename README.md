# pytorch-chemistry

This repo is forked from chainer-chemistry. Please also check [chainer-chemistry](https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-chemistry).

The main purpose of this library based on [pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) is for providing chemistry and biology tasks.

# All implementation will be moved to [kGCN_torch](https://github.com/clinfo/kGCN_torch)
